Project Overview: Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

Introduction:
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a prominent movie rental company, is embracing the digital era by launching an online video rental service to stay competitive in a market dominated by streaming giants. As a data analyst hired by the Business Intelligence department, my role is to leverage data-driven insights to guide the company's strategy for this new venture. Through SQL analysis, I aim to provide actionable answers to key business questions that will shape Rockbuster's 2020 company strategy.

Key Questions and Objectives:
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has posed critical business questions, seeking data-driven answers to inform their strategy. These questions include:

- Which movies have had the highest and lowest revenue contributions?
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- In which countries are Rockbuster customers based?
- Where are customers with high lifetime value located?
- Do sales figures vary significantly between geographic regions?

Context:
In this project, I employ SQL (Structured Query Language) to unravel insights from Rockbuster's vast dataset. Through incremental learning, I build upon SQL skills to tackle increasingly complex business questions. The results of my analysis are designed to be presented to Rockbuster's management team, visualized in an accessible format for informed decision-making. This project showcases my problem-solving abilities in a real-world context, which is transferable across industries.

Data Set:
My analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset encompassing Rockbuster's film inventory, customer information, payment records, and more. With the PostgreSQL database as the foundation, I dissect relationships across tables to unveil meaningful connections within the data. The dataset is around 3MB, comprising multiple files. Utilizing PostgreSQL, I followed meticulous instructions to load the data, setting the groundwork for insightful analysis.

Project Execution:
I tackled the Rockbuster Stealth project by following these key steps:

1. Loading Data: I carefully loaded the diverse dataset into PostgreSQL, ensuring that relationships between tables were maintained.
2. Query-Based Analysis: Leveraging SQL, I crafted queries to extract crucial insights, addressing Rockbuster's business questions one by one.
3. Visualization: Employing markdown formatting and the GitHub Markdown guide, I transformed complex insights into visually comprehensible formats.
4. Presentation: I created a video presentation highlighting the project's key findings, demonstrating my ability to communicate technical insights effectively.

Outcome and Value:
By delving into the Rockbuster Stealth project, I honed my SQL skills and showcased my capacity to provide actionable insights to inform strategic decisions. The results of my analysis are readily available through my GitHub repository, offering a transparent view of my work.
